Hello,
My name is ***Mohammad Alhanoti***. I am a **23** years old and I live in **Ramtha**, **Jordan**.
I have a bachelor's degree in **mechanical engineering** from Jordan university of science and technology in 2022.
I am about to shift my career from mechanical engineering to **software developer**.

# Here is some advices for software develoment beginners:
complexity of a code might not appers its effect at first, but by the time it will be more apparent and grows until you’re another victim of that ever-so-common horror story.
To avoid being one of the victims, you should embrace the fundamental laws of software.
## Here are the key points that every developer must master.
1. Always remember that the purpose of the software is ***to help people***.
2. Your design should be easy for you and helpful for others.
3. Bad developers don’t understand what they are doing, and good developers do. It really is that simple.
4. Complexity has nothing to do with intelligence, simplicity does.
5. Your main purpose is to control complexity, not to create it.
6. It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation.
7. Consistency is a big part of simplicity. If you do something one way in one place, do it that way in every place. 
8. The desirability of any change is directly proportional to the value of the change and inversely proportional to the effort involved in making the change.The changes that will bring you a lot of value and require little effort are better than those that will bring little value and require a lot of effort.
9. To solve any problem,The first step is understand the problem, The second thing is Think before acting and finally The third step is dividing. Don’t try to solve one big problem.Divide it into smaller tasks and solve each sub-problem one by one.
10. The incremental design should be your guide.dont try to make every thing perfect.
11. Don’t predict to future. Be only as generic as you know you need to be right now.
12. Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future.
13. Don’t reinvent the wheel.
14. As a developer, your first reaction to changing requests should be **“NO’’**.
15. If you can automate it, automate it.
16. The optimum code is a small bunch of code that is easy to understand, easy to read.
17. our main goal should be keeping your code base as small as possible. The question is not **“How can I write more code?”** rather it should be **“How can I remove more code?”**
18. **Untested code is the code that doesn’t work.**
19. Everything takes longer than you think.
20. Refactoring should be the first option.
21. Write a comment to explain **“WHY”**, not to explain **“WHAT”**.
22. Don’t depend on external technologies. But when you have to do so, try to reduce your dependency on them as much as you can.
23. Know that every specific problem has its own specific solution.
24. Don’t be obsessive. Know when to quit. Don’t hesitate to ask for help.
25. Don’t Ask Questions… Ask For Help.
